## Transfer learning links
1 : Instance-based transfer learning
  - Instance selection (marginal distributions are same while conditional distributions are different) :
    
    [TrAdaboost](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/TrAdaboost/tree/main/TrAdaBoost)

  - Instance re-weighting (conditional distributions are same while marginal distributions are different) :
    
    [KMM](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/KMMTransferRegressor)
 
2 : Feature-based transfer learning
  - Explicit distance:
      - case 1 : marginal distributions are same while conditional distributions are different:
        
         [TCA(MMD based)](https://github.com/MaterialsInformaticsDemo/TCA)  ; DAN(M-MMD based)
      - case 1 : conditional distributions are same while marginal distributions are different)
      
        JDA
      
      - case 3 : Both marginal distributions and conditional distributions are different)
      
        DDA
      
 - Implicit distance :
 
   DANN

 3 : Parameter-based transfer learning
 
 - Pretraining + fine tune
